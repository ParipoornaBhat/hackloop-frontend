i know its a very beginner level project,,

It was really a good expirience as our mentors guided really well douring the process special thanks to nandan pai and omkar prabhu,,

start with ejs and express where front and backend were in same server ,,
then i shifted to react to do them in separate servers,,

in the begging started with this as dates extended i thought of shifting to react and trying it out so,, finally finished tht also after the date extensions,,

First hackathon Really gave a great experience how can it be to work as team what all we may face during working eith others


Hope we hv done a good job in showcasing our project ,, in the end moment due to some reason we got delayed in uploading the presentation and all,, did tht in a very simple and quickly,, Which i could hv done better to make it little non boring😅

anyways whats done is done,,
