test it out using the following credentials

PASSWORD: 456456
All the passwords are encrypted while saving in mongo including these account,,

please note tht the otp feature cant be tested with these credentials as these are the test credential to checkout the features provided

i know its a very beginner level project,,

It was really a good expirience as our mentors guided really well douring the process special thanks to nandan pai and omkar prabhu,,

start with ejs and express where front and backend were in same server ,,
then i shifted to react to do them in separate servers,,

in the begging started with this as dates extended i thought of shifting to react and trying it out so,, finally finished tht also after the date extensions,,

First hackathon Really gave a great experience how can it be to work as team what all we may face during working eith others


Hope we hv done a good job in showcasing our project ,, in the end moment due to some reason we got delayed in uploading the presentation and all,, did tht in a very simple and quickly,, Which i could hv done better to make it little non boring😅

anyways whats done is done,,

+MERN stack dev Thanks to hackloop
Speacial Thanks to Flc for the 🍪 🍪 🍪 

# Also
see test out by booking atleast 2 appointment so tht ,, the second appointment details is been made such tht it will include all the previously made report of the patient by the doctor in our platforms
this feature can actually save lives even though a patient history is been followed all accross the system ,, the clinics still lack in these ,, our platforms makes it easier for them .....

[ example,, A doctor lost a patient ,, as patient didnt willing the submit the report of previous doctor with full transparency.
it might seem to be a simple feature but it is useful one for sure this example is based on true event ]
